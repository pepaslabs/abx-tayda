# abx-tayda

A relay board for performing blind A/B testing of two audio sources.

This version of the board is designed around parts available from [Tayda electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/).

See the thread at [diyaudio.com](https://www.diyaudio.com/forums/equipment-and-tools/361743-abx-box.html).

This board design is open source hardware, released under the terms of the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).  It requires an [ancient version of Kicad](https://archive.org/details/2013-kicad) (sorry, not sorry üòù).  Debian users will need to add a jessie source to install the libpng12 dependency.

[schematic](releases/v4/abx.pdf)

[gerbers.zip](releases/v4/gerbers.zip)

[firmware](https://github.com/pepaslabs/abx-tayda/blob/main/releases/v4/firmware/abx/abx.ino)

Changes from v3:
- Use 2N3906 PNP BJT's which are cheaper than BS250 P-channel MOSFETs (and are available from tayda)
- Use wider traces for the signal path.


## v3 release

[schematic](releases/v3/abx.pdf)

[gerbers.zip](releases/v3/gerbers.zip)

[firmware](https://github.com/pepaslabs/abx-tayda/blob/main/releases/v3/firmware/abx/abx.ino)

Changes from v2:
- Add test points to input X and Y for volume matching convenience.
- Use pins RX0, TX1 instead of A6, A7 (which cannot be used a digital outputs).


## v2 release

This release fixes a couple of bugs from v1:
- Replaced the 100k input resistors with proper voltage dividers.
- Fixed the silkscreen outline of the relays.
